## Razer Perl Key-color Setter

### Requirements

This assumes you already have Razer's "openrazer" package installed.

### Usage:

Currently just testing. But it will work something like this:

`keyboard.pl --config example.conf`

#### example.conf

See the file example.conf too see how I want this to work.

It should (in theory) work on all the keyboards... We'll see :)

Pull requests are cool! I am very active on github, so I'll respond quickly!
