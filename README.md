## Razer Perl Key-color Setter

### Requirements

This assumes you already have Razer's "openrazer" package installed.

### Usage:

Currently just testing. But it will work something like this:

`keyboard.pl --config example.conf`

`### example.conf ###

W, A, S, D, L_SHIFT
	#FF0000

F1-F12
	#00FF00

etc...
`

It should (in theory) work on all the keyboards... We'll see :)

Pull requests are cool! I am very active on github, so I'll respond quickly!
